furo: Great. You just wasted all our ore on a useless upgrade. Way to go.
player: ...
furo (youre_dead): There is also a board computer with which you can access Namazon. They deliver pretty quickly these days, even on these outer parts of the universe. Maybe you should order a rope or something...
player: Why do you hate me so much..? -.-
furo (youre_dead): Huh. Do I come across like I hate you? That was (not) my intention.
furo (annoyed): Oh right. I almost forgot. If you feel tired... or just want to use that rope, we all have our personal chambers.
leave furo
